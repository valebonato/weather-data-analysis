    "We will access streamflow data using the library `dataretriveal.nwis`. From the github repository, `dataretrieval` was created to simplify the process of loading hydrologic data. It is designed to retrieve the major data types of U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) hydrology data that are available on the Web, as well as data from the Water Quality Portal (WQP), which currently houses water quality data from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and USGS. Direct USGS data is obtained from a service called the National Water Information System (NWIS)."
